# helix-pi
Accessible game development, powered by genetic programming

What are you even on about bro?

Okay, so this whole project started because I was thinking about how the current models of programming make game development terribly difficult. (at least, real time, graphical game development).

I started thinking about ways we could better express the rules of video games so that humans could easily express themselves and computers could still understand.

So I had this crazy idea, where users would lay out scenarios for how games are played, and the game logic would be evolved to meet those scenarios.

I want to enable people to make games without writing code (or expressing themselves in terms of code). I want basic game development to be intuitive, accessible and iterable.

Huh.

Yeah, exactly. So at the time of writing, I've made a proof of concept for evolving simple programs to move boxes around in Javascript. It actually does work, in that I've watched it write a program to move the box in the right direction.

My vision for the short term is to create the interesting visual pieces that enable helix-pi to be used, the editor/player.
